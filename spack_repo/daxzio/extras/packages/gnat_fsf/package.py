    # There may actually be a way to install GNAT from source. If you go to
    # the GNAT Download page: https://libre.adacore.com/download/
    # select "Free Software or Academic Development", select your platform,
    # expand GNAT Ada, and expand Sources, you'll see links to download the
    # source code for GNAT and all of its dependencies. Most of these
    # dependencies are already in Spack.

    # This is the GPL release for Linux x86-64
